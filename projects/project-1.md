Amazon Spark is a place to discover things from people who share your interests. Whether you’re looking for inspiration for home décor or seeking advice for the best long-distance running shoes, Spark makes it easy to discover—and shop—stories and ideas from a community that likes what you like.

For this project, I worked on enhancing the publishing experience of the application. I had to program in both Java and React Native to implement new features on the application. We worked in an agile environment and accomplished tasks efficiently.
