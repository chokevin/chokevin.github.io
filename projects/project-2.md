In this project, I implemented the Google Nearby API in a prototype application to investigate usage in a proximity-based authenticator. The idea is that web pages would be able to change dynamically based on a pub-sub connection between a Google Nearby Hub within a smart space and a users phone.

The project was implemented Android and IntelliJ. There was a large learning curve since I had never dealt with Java before; however, I was able to quickly produce a working demonstration by the end of the semester.

In this project I gained experience with version control, mobile development, and the internet of things. This was the project that I had decided for my senior design.
